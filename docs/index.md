# PostHog Provider

This provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by [PostHog](https://posthog.com).

## Authentication

This provider requires an PostHog API token in order to manage resources.

To manage the full selection of resources, provide a user token from an account with appropriate permissions.

There are several ways to provide the required token:

* **Set the `token` argument in the provider configuration**. You can set the `token` argument in the provider configuration. Use an input variable for the token.
* **Set the `POSTHOG_TOKEN` environment variable**. The provider can read the `POSTHOG_TOKEN` environment variable and the token stored there to authenticate.

If your project is hosted outside of the PostHog Cloud US zone, you will need to pass the `host` argument to ensure the provider hits the correct API.

* For the **EU Cloud** region, set `host` to `eu.posthog.com`
* For **self-hosted** PostHog instances, set `host` to the URL of your instance

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "posthog" {}
